<h1 id="label-Usage">Usage<span><a href="#label-Usage">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p>Showoff is meant to be run in a Showoff formatted repository - that means
that it has a <code>showoff.json</code> file and a number of sections
(subdirectories) with markdown files for the slides you&#39;re presenting.</p>

<pre>$ git clone (showoff-repo)
$ cd (showoff-repo)
$ showoff serve</pre>

<p>If you run Showoff in the example subdirectory of Showoff itself, it will
show an example presentation, so you can see what it&#39;s like.</p>

<p>You can also run <code>showoff serve</code> inside a section subdirectory.
If there is no <code>showoff.json</code> file then it will make its best
guess, creating a presentation from all `.md` files in alphabetical order
in the given (or current) directory.</p>

<h2 id="label-Available+URL+Paths">Available URL Paths<span><a href="#label-Available+URL+Paths">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Once the showoff server is running, you can connect to it via a standard
modern web browser. The following URL paths are available for use by you
and your audience.</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt><a href="http://localhost:9090">localhost:9090</a>
<dd>
<p>This is the standard no-frills presentation. You can present from this if
you wish and your audience can also browse to this using the IP or DNS name
of your system. Press <code>z</code> to get hotkey help.</p>
</dd><dt><a href="http://localhost:9090/presenter">localhost:9090/presenter</a>
<dd>
<p>This view is useful for the presenter. It displays a more complete view of
your presentation, including a full tree view of all slides and presenter
notes underneath the slide itself. It will attempt to open a display window
that you can put on the projector. The display window will follow along
with the presenter window. If you have a popup blocker running, the display
window may not open. There is a button in the toolbar to manually open a
new display window in this case.</p>

<p>If password protection is enabled, this view is often protected and you
will need to authenticate to view.</p>

<p>If this path is opened by a secondary device, such as a mobile browser,
then it can also control the presentation if enabled with the <code>Enable
Remote</code>  button. Showoff tries to be intelligent about which slide
change updates to track.</p>
</dd><dt><a href="http://localhost:9090/print">localhost:9090/print</a>
<dd>
<p>This will generate printable version of your presentation, including any
slides that were tagged as <em>printonly</em>. This view can be printed
directly from the browser, or processed with any HTML-to-$thing engine.</p>
</dd><dt><a href="http://localhost:9090/download">localhost:9090/download</a>
<dd>
<p>Your slides can include files for viewers to download and these files will
be listed on this page as the presenter pages past the slide containing the
download definition.</p>
</dd><dt><a href="http://localhost:9090/stats">localhost:9090/stats</a>
<dd>
<p>The showoff server keeps track of which slides your audience is viewing and
how much time they are spending on them. Time is only accumulated for
slides that are not the slide currently being displayed. These stats are
available for consumption on this page. If the presenter views the page, a
full listing of which pages and which hosts are viewing them is shown. If
an audience member views the page, only a summary is listed.</p>
</dd><dt><a href="http://localhost:9090/supplemental/$type-name">localhost:9090/supplemental/$type-name</a>
<dd>
<p>Showoff has the ability to include supplemental material that are defined
by special slide types. This URL path will allow you and/or the audience to
retrieve the supplemental materials. This is most often used to generate
printed material ahead of time rather than during the presentation itself.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h2 id="label-Presenter+View+Tools">Presenter View Tools<span><a href="#label-Presenter+View+Tools">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>The presenter view is broken into several areas with tools that are mostly
self explanatory. Nevertheless, I&#39;ll summarize their usage.</p>

<h3 id="label-Toolbar">Toolbar<span><a href="#label-Toolbar">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>This is the black toolbar across the top of the presenter view. It has
several important tools that you should be familiar with.</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>Slide Name
<dd>
<p>This is the name of the current slide. The name is derived from the
filename that is used to generate the slide, so is exponentially more
useful than a slide number when correlating slide content with the source
file used to generate it.</p>
</dd><dt>Edit Slide
<dd>
<p>If the <code>showoff.json</code> file contains an <code>edit</code> key
then this button will allow presenters to edit the source of the current
slide using an online editor at the configured location. This is most
useful when your slide source is stored in GitHub, or another repository
that allows interactive editing. This button only appears when showoff is
called with the <code>--review</code> command line flag.</p>
</dd><dt>Report Issue With Slide
<dd>
<p>If the <code>showoff.json</code> file contains an <code>issues</code> key
then this button will allow presenters to report problems with the slide
currently being viewed using the configured issue tracker.</p>
</dd><dt>Viewing Statistics
<dd>
<p>Drops down a menu of the viewer stats from the <code>/stats</code> URL
path. Contains a link to open the full page in a new window.</p>
</dd><dt>Downloads
<dd>
<p>Drops down a menu of all available downloads. Contains a link to open the
full page in a new window.</p>
</dd><dt>Display Window
<dd>
<p>Opens the display window or attempts to reconnect to an existing window.
This window is useful to place on a projector. The presentation can be
controlled from either the Display Window or the Presenter View.</p>
</dd><dt>Next Window
<dd>
<p>Opens a small preview window for the next upcoming slide.</p>
</dd><dt>Notes Window
<dd>
<p>Opens a separate and resizable instructor notes window.</p>
</dd><dt>Print Slides
<dd>
<p>Prints the slides using the browser&#39;s native print functionality. Many
browsers allow you to print to PDF.</p>
</dd><dt>Switch View
<dd>
<p>Changes to the Display view that your audience normally sees.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3 id="label-Presenter+Tools">Presenter Tools<span><a href="#label-Presenter+Tools">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>Countdown Timer
<dd>
<p>This is just a simple countdown timer. Enter the time allotted to your
presentation and it will begin counting down for you, changing color as it
approaches zero.</p>
</dd><dt>Pace Feedback Gauge
<dd>
<p>When the audience provides pace feedback for you, it will appear on this
gauge. You should aim to keep the gauge near the center. The left side
indicates that you are moving too slowly and the right side is too fast.
The feedback messages decay over time and will expire in about five
minutes–meaning that the gauge will move back towards the center.</p>
</dd><dt>Slideshow Tree
<dd>
<p>On the left side of the browser window is a tree like view of the
presentation. Each subsection is displayed at the top level. Click on any
of these subsections and it will expand to list all the slides in that
section, or collapse again. Click on any slide name and the presentation
will immediately jump to that slide.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3 id="label-Presentation+Preview">Presentation Preview<span><a href="#label-Presentation+Preview">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>This contains a scaled down version of the current slide. It will attempt
to size it to fit your screen and scale the contents as closely as
possible. Several tools are attached to the bottom of this view.</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>Update Follower
<dd>
<p>Allow other viewers in Follow Mode to track your progress.</p>
</dd><dt>Enable Remote
<dd>
<p>Allow remote windows, including mobile devices, to control the presentation
by opening the presenter view. This button will glow yellow when Showoff is
listening for remote updates. Please see <a
href="#label-Follow+Mode">Follow Mode</a> and <a
href="#label-Remote+Control">Remote Control</a> below for more information.</p>
</dd><dt>Zoom
<dd>
<p>Zoom in and out of the preview.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3 id="label-Presenter+Information">Presenter Information<span><a href="#label-Presenter+Information">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>Audience Questions
<dd>
<p>When an audience member uses the anonymous <em>Ask Question</em> feature,
it will appear in this list. The questions are listed in reverse order,
with the newest at the top.</p>
</dd><dt>Notes
<dd>
<p>Just displays all presenter nodes, including any markup, syntax
highlighting, etc.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h2 id="label-Hotkeys">Hotkeys<span><a href="#label-Hotkeys">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>The following hotkeys are available for usage while viewing the slideshow.
See CONFIGURATION.rdoc for information on remapping these keys.</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>z, ?
<dd>
<p>Toggle help. This shows a reference table on screen.</p>
</dd><dt>space, →
<dd>
<p>Advance to the next slide.</p>
</dd><dt>shift-space, ←
<dd>
<p>Move to previous slide.</p>
</dd><dt>d
<dd>
<p>Toggle debug mode. This will show information including the keys pressed
and the content filename that is used to generate the current slide in the
footer area.</p>
</dd><dt>## &lt;return&gt;
<dd>
<p>Go to slide #. Type a number and press &lt;return&gt; and you will
immediately jump to that slide.</p>
</dd><dt>c, t
<dd>
<p>Table of contents. A dropdown menu allowing you to choose a section &amp;
slide will appear.</p>
</dd><dt>f
<dd>
<p>Toggle footer. The footer contains the progress indicator.</p>
</dd><dt>g
<dd>
<p>Toggle follow mode. When follow mode is enabled, the presentation will
track the page displayed by the presenter. This is often useful when an
audience member has poor eyesight and would like to get a better view of
your screen.</p>
</dd><dt>r
<dd>
<p>Reload slides. This will reload your presentation as you generate or refine
content.</p>
</dd><dt>n
<dd>
<p>Toggle notes. This will place the first line of text from the slide notes
in the footer.</p>
</dd><dt>p
<dd>
<p>Run preshow. Start the preshow slideshow. This will cycle through images
placed in <code>_preshow</code> for a specified time. This is useful for
taking timed breaks or for keeping the audience attention while waiting for
you to begin.</p>
</dd><dt>P
<dd>
<p>Toggle pause. This will pause the presentation and dim the screen. You can
use this to take a brief moment to address tangential audience questions.</p>
</dd><dt>b
<dd>
<p>Toggle screenblanker. Similar to pause, this will pause the presentation
and slide the slide off screen.</p>
</dd><dt>s
<dd>
<p>Choose style. Pull open the style chooser menu. You can embed multiple
styles (for example, style target at different screen sizes or audiences)
and use this menu to choose the appropriate style.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h2 id="label-Follow+Mode">Follow Mode<span><a href="#label-Follow+Mode">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>The audience can choose to follow along with the presentation
automatically, and the presenter may control the presentation in a few
different ways. Showoff implements several strategies for keeping all views
of the presentation in sync.</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>Audience Follow Mode
<dd>
<p>If an audience member switches into follow mode by pressing the
<code>g</code> hotkey, then their browser will automatically change slides
to follow along with the presentation.</p>
</dd><dt>Display Window
<dd>
<p>When the presenter changes slides from either the Presenter View or the
Display Window then the other view switches to match.</p>
</dd><dt>Remote Control
<dd>
<p>If the presenter opens multiple presenter views, then Showoff tries to
heuristically guess which view should be the “controller” at any given
time. This is most useful when the presenter opens the presenter view on a
mobile device for a remote control.</p>

<p>The presenter view will consider itself to be the authoritative source of
the current slide indicator as long as you are actively using it. When you
have not pressed a key for 30 seconds, it will also switch into Follow Mode
and will track slide updates from remotes. The on screen indicator below
the slide preview will glow yellow when it has switched into Follow Mode.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h2 id="label-Remote+Control">Remote Control<span><a href="#label-Remote+Control">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Open the presenter view on a mobile device for a simplified remote control
view of your presentation. You will get a slide preview, plus presentation
notes. If you scroll down, you will also see the presentation tree and can
navigate to any slide. If the main presenter is in Follow Mode, then it
will track slide updates.</p>

<p>To save battery, the Remote Control does not listen for slide updates.
Instead, there is a manual <code>Update</code> button, which will request
the current slide from the Showoff server and change to it.</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>Advance slide forward
<dd>
<p>Tap on the slide, or swipe from right to left.</p>
</dd><dt>Return to a previous slide
<dd>
<p>Swipe from left to right.</p>
</dd><dt>Update
<dd>
<p>Press this button to quickly change to the current slide being displayed by
the Presenter view.</p>
</dd><dt>Update Follower
<dd>
<p>Enable this toggle to act as a Remote Control. Disable it to navigate
through the slide deck without updating the slide being projected.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p><em>Warning, using the Remote Control will chew the hell out of your phone
battery.</em></p>

<h1 id="label-Command+Line+Usage">Command Line Usage<span><a href="#label-Command+Line+Usage">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<h2 id="label-showoff+help+-5Bcommand-5D"><code>showoff help [command]</code><span><a href="#label-showoff+help+-5Bcommand-5D">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

print the page using your browser&#39;s native print function. Another
option is using a rendering engine such as <a
href="http://www.princexml.com">PrinceXML</a> to print this page to a PDF.</p>

<h1 id="label-Shell+Auto+Completion">Shell Auto Completion<span><a href="#label-Shell+Auto+Completion">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<h2 id="label-ZSH+completion">ZSH completion<span><a href="#label-ZSH+completion">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>You can complete commands and options in ZSH, by installing a script:</p>

<pre>mkdir -p $HOME/.zsh/Completion
cp script/_showoff $HOME/.zsh/Completion
echo &#39;fpath=(~/.zsh/Completion $fpath)&#39; &gt;&gt; $HOME/.zshrc</pre>

<h2 id="label-bash+completion"><code>bash</code> completion<span><a href="#label-bash+completion">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>You can complete commands for showoff by putting the following in your
<code>.bashrc</code> (or whatever you use when starting <code>bash</code>):</p>

<pre>complete -F get_showoff_commands
function get_showoff_commands()
{
    if [ -z $2 ] ; then
        COMPREPLY=(`showoff help -c`)
    else
        COMPREPLY=(`showoff help -c $2`)
    fi
}</pre>

<p>You can also install that as an executable script such as
<code>/etc/bash_completion.d/showoff</code>.</p>
